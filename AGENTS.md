# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

# Calavera Agent Guidance

- Use Calavera when the user wants to inspect, compose, preview, apply, or update project tooling.
- Verify the Calavera MCP tools are available before composing a recipe.
- Prefer the Calavera MCP server over hand-authoring `calavera.config.json`.
- If the Calavera MCP tools are not available, stop and help the user register the MCP server from `.agents/calavera/mcp.md`, then reload the agent session if the MCP host requires it.
- Do not inspect npm cache internals or import Calavera source files from a package cache as a substitute for MCP setup.
- Inspect existing project tooling before composing a recipe and raise likely config conflicts early.
- If likely conflicts exist, pause before applying changes. List each conflict as a hard stop or a migration decision the user can approve, and use `dry_run_apply` to show concrete impact when adoption still looks possible.
- Start with `inspect_project`, `list_profiles`, `list_integrations`, and `list_ai_artifacts`; use `describe_integration` when the user asks for more information or an option needs explanation.
- Choose either Oxfmt or Prettier for formatting; do not select both in the same recipe.
- Compose recipes with `compose_recipe`, validate them with `validate_recipe`, and explain the selected integrations with `explain_recipe`.
- Always present `dry_run_apply` output to the user before changing files.
- Call `apply_recipe` only after the user explicitly approves the dry-run result.
- If the MCP transport closes or reports `-32000` during or immediately after `apply_recipe`, treat the outcome as unknown instead of failed. Inspect `calavera.config.json`, `.calavera/state.json`, generated files, and package metadata before retrying the apply.
- Treat files listed by `dry_run_apply` as Calavera-managed outputs. Do not hand-write or edit them; let `apply_recipe` or `create-project-calavera apply` create them after approval.
- Use AskUserTool or the agent client's equivalent when available for profile choices, conflict decisions, and apply approval.

MCP setup notes live in `.agents/calavera/mcp.md`.

# Simple Reader workflow

- The initial implementation is the only work permitted directly on `main`. After the baseline implementation, update `main` and create a feature branch before editing files.
- Follow strict red/green/refactor TDD. Confirm each red test fails for the intended missing behavior before writing the minimum implementation that makes it green.
- The primary agent owns architecture and integration. Delegate bounded, non-overlapping work to suitable sub-agents, then review every contributed diff before accepting it.
- Use `gh` for GitHub operations. Use the in-app GitHub connector only when it is reliable for the exact operation.
- Use [Varlock](https://varlock.dev) for all configuration and secrets. Never inspect, print, commit, or request raw secret values.
- Before relevant work, read the applicable project skill and its required references completely. Follow the skills instead of duplicating their guidance here:
  - `.agents/skills/calavera/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/css-coder/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/css-tokens/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/frontend-security/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/frontend-testing/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/more-secure-dependabot-config/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/semantic-html/SKILL.md`
  - `.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md`
